# ðŸ‘˜ðŸ‘—Fashion Store Crawler

I created an application that crawls the fashion store brand [Reformation](https://reformation.com/) and extracts product information. 

## About the Project

A coding challenge was provided by Changing Room, a Honey extension for sustainable fashion that helps users track and reduce their environmental impact. The coding challenge features an application that crawls a fashion brand's website using a crawler framework (in this case Selenium), extracts information in a structured manner, and stores the data in a hosted database (AWS RDS).

Extrac

## Process

pip install foobar
```

import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
